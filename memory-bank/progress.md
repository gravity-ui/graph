## Next Steps

1. **API Refinement**: Review and refine the public API to ensure consistency and ease of use.

2. **Plugin Architecture**: Develop a plugin system to allow for easier extensibility.

3. **Performance Benchmarking**: Create comprehensive performance tests to identify bottlenecks.

4. **Documentation Expansion**: Add more examples and tutorials to help developers understand the library.

5. **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensure the library meets accessibility standards for interactive visualizations.

6. **Mobile Optimization**: Improve support for touch interactions and mobile devices.

- [ ] **Refactoring of Settings and Constants**

[2025-04-03 18:32:48] - Added new task to separate plugin-specific constants, settings, and colors from the core graph library, moving them to their respective plugin modules for better separation of concerns and maintainability.


7. **External Layout Integration**: Enhance integration with external layout algorithms like ELK.

8. **React Component Enhancements**: Improve the React wrapper components for better integration with React applications.

2025-04-03 15:09:56 - Updated with comprehensive task tracking based on the library documentation, including completed tasks, current tasks, and next steps.


[2025-04-03 18:36:41] - Improved the documentation structure in docs/README.md by simplifying the organization, adding visual hierarchy with tables, streamlining the quick start example, and grouping documentation topics logically. This makes the library's documentation more accessible and easier to navigate.
[2025-04-03 18:21:15] - Enhanced the graph-settings.md documentation by analyzing the codebase to identify and document only the settings and constants that are actually used. Removed unused settings from documentation to improve clarity and focus.


[2025-04-03 18:47:00] - Improved the component lifecycle documentation (docs/system/component-lifecycle.md) by completely reorganizing and restructuring the content. Added tables for better scannability, split complex flowcharts into focused diagrams, simplified explanations, and added a clear numerical section structure. This makes the component lifecycle system more accessible to developers and addresses the "Documentation and Examples" focus area mentioned in activeContext.md.

[2025-04-03 18:16:42] - Completed documentation for graph settings. Created a comprehensive graph-settings.md file and updated the README.md to properly reference it in the documentation section and table of contents. The documentation includes detailed information about configuration options, colors, and constants with practical examples.

[2025-04-03 19:03:11] - Created a new integration document `docs/system/component-rendering-lifecycle.md` that connects the component lifecycle, rendering mechanism, and scheduler system documentation. Added cross-references between all four documents to improve navigation and highlight their relationships. This makes the documentation more cohesive and helps developers understand how these interconnected systems work together.

[2025-04-03 19:36:08] - Updated method references in canvas-graph-component.md documentation. Changed all instances of `getCameraScale()` to `getCameraBlockScaleLevel()`, which is the correct method to use for determining appropriate level of detail when rendering components.

[2025-04-03 19:44:39] - Updated the GraphComponent documentation to better describe mouse event handling capabilities. Replaced the narrow 'Universal Drag Behavior' section with a more comprehensive 'Mouse Event Handling' section that explains all the event handling capabilities of GraphComponent, including basic events (click, mouseenter, etc.) and the specialized drag system.

[2025-04-03 19:48:25] - Enhanced GraphComponent documentation with technical details about spatial indexing and culling. Added information about the R-tree spatial index used for efficient hitbox lookups (O(log n) complexity), and clarified that visibility checks are based on checking if component hitboxes are within the camera's view area.



[2025-04-03 19:39:38] - Updated documentation in canvas-graph-component.md to correctly use ECameraScaleLevel enum instead of numeric comparisons. Changed all instances to reference the proper enum values (Minimalistic, Schematic, Detailed) rather than comparing with numeric values. Added proper imports to code examples.



[2025-04-03 19:27:55] - Fixed and enhanced canvas-graph-component.md documentation to correct technical inaccuracies. Removed references to BatchPath2D (which isn't connected to GraphComponent) and clarified that the library requires absolute positioning for all child components. Also expanded examples to demonstrate proper positioning for components in different contexts.


[2025-04-03 19:18:27] - Fixed corrupted documentation in `docs/components/canvas-graph-component.md`. Completed the unfinished AnnotatedConnection class example and added missing content for all incomplete sections including performance tips, GraphComponent usage contexts, and real-world use cases. The documentation now provides comprehensive guidance on using GraphComponents effectively in various situations.


[2025-04-03 19:07:30] - Simplified the documentation for component lifecycle, rendering mechanism, and scheduler system to eliminate redundant information. Each document now focuses on its specific concerns with cross-references to related documents. The comprehensive integration document serves as the central reference for understanding how these systems work together.
