## Layer System Overview
Layers are fundamental to the Canvas rendering pipeline in @gravity-ui/graph. They organize drawable components and manage rendering order and performance. They ensure that elements like backgrounds, connections, blocks, and interactive elements are drawn in the correct sequence.

**Primary Goal: Extensibility:** Layers are the primary mechanism for extending the library's core functionality. If a user request involves adding new visual elements or behaviors without altering the base logic, creating a new custom layer is the preferred approach.

## Key Layer Concepts
- **Purpose:** Each layer is responsible for a specific aspect of the graph, which can include **rendering visual elements** (e.g., `BackgroundLayer`, `ConnectionLayer`) or **managing behavior and logic** (e.g., handling specific user interactions, managing non-visual state). A layer might not have a direct visual representation but still participate in the graph's lifecycle and logic.
- **Location:** Core layer logic and specific layer implementations are found in `src/components/canvas/layers/` and potentially base classes/services like `src/services/Layer.ts`.
- **Rendering Order/Priority:** Layers are rendered/processed in a specific sequence determined by the main graph component. The order is crucial for visual correctness and logical flow (e.g., connections below blocks, interaction handlers processed before rendering). Typical order might be: Background -> Connections -> Blocks -> Groups -> Behavior/Interaction Layers -> Highlight Layers.
- **Performance:** Layers optimize rendering and processing by:
    - Drawing/processing only elements or logic relevant to that layer.
    - Potentially culling elements outside the current viewport.
    - Managing redraws or logic updates based on relevant state changes.

## Layer Lifecycle and DOM Operations

- **Layer Initialization Sequence:**
  1. **Creation (`constructor` → `init`)**: Layer is created, but not yet attached to DOM
  2. **Attachment (`attachLayer` → `afterInit`)**: Layer is attached to DOM
  3. **Updates (rendering cycle)**: Layer responds to changes
  4. **Detachment (`detachLayer` → `unmount`)**: Layer is removed from DOM

- **DOM Operation Timing:** Any operations that require the layer to be attached to the DOM (such as DOM manipulations, style injections, measurements, or accessing parent elements) must be performed in the `afterInit` method, not in `init` or the constructor.

- **Why This Matters:** During the creation phase, the root element may be undefined or not yet attached to the document. The `afterInit` method is guaranteed to be called after the layer is properly attached to the DOM, ensuring that DOM operations work correctly.

## Working with Layers
- **Layers are Components:** Treat layers as specialized components. They follow the standard component lifecycle (`mount`, `unmount`, `render`, `stateChanged`, etc.) and **all general component rules (see `components-rules`) apply to layers as well**. A layer's `render` method might be empty if it only handles behavior.
- **Creating New Layers:**
    - If adding new types of visual elements or behaviors, create a new layer class.
    - New layers should ideally extend a base `Layer` class or a suitable existing layer, inheriting common functionality.
    - Register the new layer in the main graph's processing pipeline in the correct order.
- **Modifying Existing Layers:**
    - When changing how elements are rendered or behaviors are managed, modify the relevant methods (e.g., `render`, event handlers) of the corresponding layer.
    - Ensure efficiency; avoid unnecessary computations or drawing invisible elements.
- **Interaction & Behavior:** Layers are suitable for encapsulating specific interaction logic (e.g., drag-and-drop handling, tool activation). These layers might not draw anything but listen to events and modify the graph state.
- **Event Propagation & Camera Interaction:** Since layers are often added directly to the root container (and not nested within the `GraphLayer` which handles core event delegation and contains the `Camera`), mouse events intended for camera interactions (like panning via click/drag) might be intercepted by the layer. To ensure the camera receives these events, you may need to override the layer's `getParent()` method to directly return the camera component: `return this.props.graph.getGraphLayer().$.camera;`. This effectively bypasses the standard hierarchy for event bubbling, delegating the event to the camera. *Note:* This is a workaround; be mindful of potential side effects on other event handling within your layer. See the `BlockGroups` layer (`src/components/canvas/groups/BlockGroups.ts`) for a practical example.
- **State Management:** Layers typically access the graph's central state store (`store/`) to get the data they need and to dispatch changes. Use reactive patterns (signals) to trigger updates when relevant data changes.
- **Cleanup:** Implement necessary cleanup in the layer's `destroy` or `unmount` method to release resources, remove listeners, etc.
