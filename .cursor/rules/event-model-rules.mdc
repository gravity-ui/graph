## Event System Overview
The event system allows communication between different parts of the graph.
The primary event hub is the main **`Graph` instance**. Events related to specific components (like blocks or connections) are also typically emitted by the main `Graph` instance, carrying information about the target component in the event detail.

The system uses **`CustomEvent`**, and interaction follows a `.on`/`.off`/`.emit` pattern on the `Graph` instance.

## Key Concepts
- **Event Emitter:** The main `Graph` instance is the primary emitter.
- **Event Object:** Instances of `CustomEvent`. Data is in **`event.detail`**.
- **Target Component:** For interaction events (e.g., `block:select`, `click`), `event.detail.target` often references the specific `GraphComponent` interacted with.
- **Source Event:** `event.detail.sourceEvent` may contain the original low-level DOM/Canvas event.
- **Event Types:** String names. See `docs/system/events.md` for a list.
- **Subscription API (Core):** Uses **`graph.on(event, callback, options)`**.
- **Unsubscription API (Core):** Uses **`graph.off(event, callback)`**. **Crucial for cleanup.**
- **Control Flow:** Standard `event.preventDefault()` and `event.stopPropagation()` can be used on the `CustomEvent` object.

## Working with Events

### 1. Subscribing to Graph Events (Core API)
   - **How:** Use the main `Graph` instance.
   - **API:** `graph.on(eventName, callback, options)`.
   - **Context:** Access the graph instance via `this.context.graph` in non-React components.
   - **Use Case:** Reacting to global changes or interactions outside of React components. Remember to manage unsubscription manually (e.g., in `unmount`).
   ```typescript
   // Example: Global camera update listener in a non-React component
   const unsubscribeCamera = this.context.graph.on('camera:update', (event: CustomEvent</* TCameraState */>) => {
     const cameraState = event.detail;
     console.log('Camera moved:', cameraState);
   });
   // In unmount(): if (unsubscribeCamera) unsubscribeCamera();
   ```

### 2. Handling Events in React (`<GraphCanvas>` wrapper)
   - **Obtaining the Graph Instance:** Within React components, the `Graph` instance needed for event handling (especially with `useGraphEvent`) is typically obtained using the **`useGraph()`** hook: `const { graph } = useGraph(config);`.
   - **Method A (Recommended): `useGraphEvent` Hook:** The primary way to listen to graph events within React function components.
     - **Requires:** The `graph` instance obtained from `useGraph()`.
     - **Pros:** Automatically handles subscription/unsubscription; provides `detail` and `event` objects.
     - **Cons:** Only usable within React function components.
     ```jsx
     import { useGraph, useGraphEvent, GraphCanvas } from '@gravity-ui/graph';

     function MyReactComponent() {
       const { graph } = useGraph(/* config */);

       useGraphEvent(graph, 'block:select', (detail, event) => {
         console.log('React Hook: Block selected:', detail.target?.id);
       });

       // ... other useGraphEvent calls

       return <GraphCanvas graph={graph} /* ... */ />;
     }
     ```
   - **Method B: `onEventName` Props:** Use dedicated props on **`<GraphCanvas>`** for common, predefined events.
     - **Requires:** Passing the `graph` instance to `<GraphCanvas>`.
     - **Pros:** Declarative, simple for common cases.
     - **Cons:** Limited to the specific events exposed as props.
     ```jsx
     import { GraphCanvas } from '@gravity-ui/graph';

     // ... assume graph instance is available

     <GraphCanvas
       graph={graph}
       onBlockSelectionChange={(event: CustomEvent<SelectionEvent<TBlockId>>) => {
         console.log('React Prop: Blocks selected:', event.detail.list);
       }}
       // ... other props
     />
     ```

### General Best Practices
- **Prioritize `useGraphEvent`:** In React, prefer the hook for its robustness and lifecycle management.
- **Always Unsubscribe (Core API):** If using `graph.on` directly (outside React hooks), ensure cleanup with `graph.off()`.
- **Use `event.detail`:** Access event-specific data here.
- **Check `event.detail.target`:** Identify the specific component involved.
- **Emit Custom Events:** Use `graph.emit(...)` to broadcast custom global events.
- **Performance:** Avoid heavy logic in listeners.

## Preferred Event Subscription Pattern

### Using AbortController
When implementing event subscriptions in this project:

1. **Prefer AbortController over manual unsubscribe functions**
   - Use the AbortController pattern for managing event listeners
   - Pass the abort signal to all `graph.on()` calls and DOM event listeners
   - This ensures proper cleanup and prevents memory leaks
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     // Preferred approach
     const controller = new AbortController();
     graph.on("event-name", handler, { signal: controller.signal });
     
     // Later, to clean up:
     controller.abort();
     
     // Instead of:
     const unsubscribe = graph.on("event-name", handler);
     // Later:
     unsubscribe();
     ```

2. **In Layer classes**
   - Use the built-in `eventAbortController` for all event subscriptions
   - Always use the wrapper methods (`onGraphEvent`, `onHtmlEvent`, `onCanvasEvent`, `onRootEvent`) in the `afterInit()` method, NOT in the constructor
   - This ensures that event subscriptions are properly set up when the layer is reattached
   - When a layer is unmounted, the AbortController is aborted and a new one is created
   - When the layer is reattached, afterInit() is called again, which sets up new subscriptions
   - Call `super.afterInit()` at the end of your `afterInit()` method
   - Call `super.unmount()` in the `unmount` method to ensure proper cleanup
   - No need to manually remove event listeners in the `unmount` method
   - Example:
     ```typescript
     export class MyLayer extends Layer {
       constructor(props) {
         super(props);
         // Initialize properties, but DO NOT register event listeners here
       }
       
       protected afterInit(): void {
         // Register graph events with the onGraphEvent wrapper method
         this.onGraphEvent("camera-change", this.handleCameraChange);
         
         // Register DOM events with the appropriate wrapper methods
         if (this.canvas) {
           this.onCanvasEvent("mousedown", this.handleMouseDown);
         }
         
         if (this.html) {
           this.onHtmlEvent("click", this.handleHtmlClick);
         }
         
         if (this.root) {
           this.onRootEvent("keydown", this.handleRootKeyDown);
         }
         
         // Always call super.afterInit() at the end
         super.afterInit();
       }
     }
     ```
