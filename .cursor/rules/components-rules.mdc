# General Component Rules
- use `setState` instead direct setting new value via `this.state =`
- use `setProps` instead direct setting new value via `this.props =`
- use `Component.create(props)` method to creating a children component instead `new Component(props)`
- for creating children component use only method `updateChildren` 
```typescript 
protected updateChildren() {
  return [Component.create(...props)]
}
```
- Update the hit box when geometry changes using the `setHitBox` method.
- Use `isVisible()` method to check component visibility in viewport before rendering.
- Clean up resources properly by implementing custom cleanup in the `unmount` method.
- Use `subscribeSignal` for reactive updates instead of manual event handling.
- Use theme colors from context: `ctx.fillStyle = this.context.colors.block.background`.
- Override `stateChanged` method to optimize rendering and perform specific actions when data changes.
- Use `shouldRender = false` to skip unnecessary renders.

# Canvas Component Structure
Canvas components are located in src/components/canvas/ and divided into several categories:
- blocks/ - graph blocks
- connections/ - connections between blocks
- anchors/ - anchors for connections
- layers/ - layers for rendering various elements
- groups/ - element grouping

# React Integration
For integration of Canvas components with React, wrappers are used in the src/react-component/ directory. These components allow the use of Canvas in React applications.

# Rendering Layers
Canvas rendering is organized in layers with different priorities:
- Background layer (low priority)
- Block layer (medium priority)
- Connection layer (medium priority)
- Selection and interactive elements layer (high priority)

# Zoom Levels
The scaling system automatically switches between Canvas and HTML/React:
- Low zoom (ECameraScaleLevel.LOW) - everything is rendered on Canvas
- Medium zoom (ECameraScaleLevel.MEDIUM) - schematic view with basic interactivity
- High zoom (ECameraScaleLevel.HIGH) - full React components for rich interactivity

# Block Component Rules
- Custom block components must extend the `Block` class from `Block.ts`.
- Do not transform original coordinates onto world coordinates in components.
- Scale line widths based on camera zoom: `ctx.lineWidth = Math.round(2 / this.context.camera.getCameraScale())`.
- Implement both schematic and detailed views for components.
- Handle selection state appropriately in render methods.
- Optimize text rendering based on zoom level.

# Connection Component Rules
- Use appropriate curve calculations for connection paths.
- Update connection path when connected blocks change position.
- Implement proper hit detection for connection lines.
- Handle connection selection state visually.
- When using BatchPath2DRenderer, prefer `update()` over conditional `add()`/`delete()` logic. The `update()` method internally calls `delete()` followed by `add()`, making it unnecessary to track whether an item has been added to the batch.

# Performance Considerations
When working with Canvas components:
- Minimize the number of redraws
- Use caching for complex calculations
- Apply only necessary transformations
- Render only visible elements in the current viewport

# Custom Rendering
For creating custom components:
- Use the renderBlock property in GraphCanvas to override block display
- Implement custom components by inheriting from base classes
- Monitor performance when creating complex custom renderers
