# Story Creation Rules

## Documentation and References
- Read the `docs/react/usage.md` for general React integration documentation.
- Refer to `/src/stories/Playground` for complex examples.
- Always use `GraphBlock` for rendering graph blocks in the HTML layer unless you have a specific custom renderer.

## Graph Initialization (Recommended Pattern)
- **Use `useGraph` hook:** Initialize the graph instance within your story component using the `useGraph` hook from `src/react-component/hooks/useGraph.ts`.
  ```typescript
  import { useGraph, GraphCanvas, GraphBlock } from "@gravity-ui/graph"; // Adjust path as needed
  
  const MyStoryComponent = (props) => {
      const { graph } = useGraph({
          // Initial graph configuration (e.g., layers, renderBlock)
          layers: [[MyCustomLayer, { customProp: 'value' }]],
          renderBlock: (g, block) => <GraphBlock graph={g} block={block}>...</GraphBlock>
      });
      // ... useEffect for setting data and starting
      return <GraphCanvas graph={graph} ... />;
  };
  ```
- **Set data and start in `useEffect`:** Use a `useEffect` hook (with `graph` as a dependency) to populate the graph with data (`graph.setEntities({ blocks: ..., connections: ... })`) and then start the graph (`graph.start()`). This ensures the graph is ready before data is loaded.
  ```typescript
  useEffect(() => {
      if (graph) {
          graph.setEntities({ blocks: blocksData, connections: connectionsData });
          graph.start();
      }
  }, [graph]);
  ```
- **Avoid direct `new Graph()` in story render:** While possible, using `useGraph` is preferred as it integrates better with React's lifecycle and state management for stories.

## Data Types and Required Fields
- Ensure blocks have all required TBlock fields:
  ```typescript
  {
    is: "Block" as const,
    selected: false,
    name: string,
    anchors: [],
    // other fields...
  }
  ```
- Connections must include `sourceBlockId` and `targetBlockId`
- Use generics to extend block data types if needed

## Component Structure
- Use `GraphCanvas` as the main container component
- Wrap custom block content in `GraphBlock` component
- Utilize `className` prop on `GraphBlock` for styling
- Set explicit container dimensions (e.g., `height: "600px"`)

## UI Integration
- Import and include UI library styles if using one
- Wrap story in appropriate theme provider if needed
- Use design system tokens/CSS variables for consistent styling
- Use `useCallback` for `renderBlock` function to prevent unnecessary rerenders

## Best Practices
- Keep blocks and connections data outside the component
- Use `useEffect` for graph initialization and setup
- Follow the UI library's design system guidelines
- Ensure proper cleanup in useEffect if needed
- Test different zoom levels to verify both canvas and HTML rendering
- **Testing Layers:** When creating stories for custom layers or components that interact heavily with the canvas/camera:
    - Test behavior under different DPR settings (if possible, simulate different device pixel ratios).
    - Verify rendering and interactions at various zoom levels (`ECameraScaleLevel.LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`) and during camera panning.
    - Test edge cases, like empty data or interactions near viewport boundaries.
