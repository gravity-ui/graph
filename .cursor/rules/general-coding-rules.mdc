## Type Safety

### Avoid `any` Type
- **Never use the `any` type** in your code. Instead:
  - Use specific types whenever possible (e.g., `PointerEvent`, `KeyboardEvent`, `HTMLElement`)
  - Use `void` for function return types when the function doesn't return a value
  - Use `unknown` only as a last resort when the type is truly unpredictable
  - Implement appropriate interfaces (e.g., `EventListenerObject`) instead of type casting
  - Use generics to create flexible but type-safe APIs

### Type Casting
- Avoid type casting with `as any`
- If type casting is necessary, use `as unknown as TargetType` to make the cast more explicit and safer
- Prefer type guards (`instanceof`, `typeof`, custom type predicates) over type casting

## Code Quality

### Function Return Types
- Always specify return types for functions
- Use `void` for functions that don't return a value
- Be explicit about nullable return types (e.g., `string | null`)

### Error Handling
- Use specific error types instead of generic `Error`
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Handle errors at the appropriate level

### Documentation
- Document public APIs with JSDoc comments
- Include parameter descriptions and return type descriptions
- Document complex logic with inline comments

## Performance

### Event Handlers
- Keep event handlers lightweight
- Debounce or throttle handlers for frequent events (resize, scroll, pointermove)
- Clean up event listeners when components are unmounted

### Memory Management
- Avoid memory leaks by properly cleaning up resources
- Use AbortController for managing event listeners
- Unsubscribe from subscriptions when components are unmounted
