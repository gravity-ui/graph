# @gravity-ui/graph

> @gravity-ui/graph is a graph visualization library that combines the best of both worlds: Canvas for high performance when viewing the full graph and HTML/React for rich interactions when zoomed in.

Key features:
- High-performance Canvas rendering for displaying the full graph
- Automatic switching to HTML/React mode when zooming in for interactive elements
- Smart system that tracks visible blocks and renders only them in React
- Extensible architecture through layers (custom rendering layers that act as plugins)
- Full TypeScript support
- Organized rendering system with layer-based architecture
